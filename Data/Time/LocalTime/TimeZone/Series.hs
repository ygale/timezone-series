-- $abouttzs
-- A @TimeZoneSeries@ describes a timezone with a set of 'TimeZone'
-- objects. Each @TimeZone@ object describes the clock setting in the
-- timezone for a specific period of history during which the clocks
-- do not change.
--
-- Most operating systems provide information about timezone series
-- for the local timezone and for many other timezones of the world.
-- On MS Windows systems, this information can be read from the
-- registry. On other systems, this information is typically provided
-- in the form of Olson timezone files: \/etc\/localtime (or some
-- other file) for the local timezone, and files located in
-- \/usr\/share\/zoneinfo\/ or \/etc\/zoneinfo\/ (or some other
-- directory) for other timezones.

-- | A @TimeZoneSeries@ consists of a default @TimeZone@ object and a
-- sequence of pairs of a @UTCTime@ and a @TimeZone@ object. Each
-- @UTCTime@ indicates a moment at which the clocks changed, and the
-- corresponding @TimeZone@ object describes the new state of the
-- clocks after the change. The default @TimeZone@ object is used for
-- times preceding the earliest @UTCTime@, or if the sequence of pairs
-- is empty. The times in the sequence are in order from latest to
-- earlist (note that this is the opposite of the way that they are
-- stored in an Olson timezone file).

-- The following functions attempt to deal correctly with corner cases
-- where multiple clock changes overlap with each other, even though

-- The theorem is that if G is the set of individual time changes
-- for which t is invalid ("in the Gap"), and O is the set of
-- individual time changes for which t is redundant ("in the Overlap"),
-- then t is invalid for the full set of changes iff #G > #O, and
-- t is redundant for the full set of changes iff #G < #O.

-- The following functions are variants on functions in
-- "Data.Time.LocalTime" that convert between UTC and local time. The
-- originals can give a wrong result if the 'TimeZone' used for the
-- conversion is not actually in effect at the specified time. These
-- variants use a 'TimeZoneSeries' instead of a 'TimeZone'.
--
-- When converting from an invalid local time, the local time is
-- interpreted as if the time change that made it invalid never
-- happened.  When converting from a redundant local time, the latest
-- possible interpretation is used. Use the functions
-- 'isValidLocalTime' and 'isRedundantLocalTime' to detect these
-- conditions.
